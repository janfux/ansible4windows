# Ansible on Windows

## Motive

Set up a Windows PC for development of Ansible playbooks.
Installs Visual Studio Code, Chocolatey package manager, WSL Ubuntu 18.04, Docker, Virtualbox, Vagrant and other programs ready to use.

For usage ideas, see: <https://www.frostbyte.us/configure-an-ansible-testing-system-on-windows-part-1/>

## Todo

- move vagrant from windows to linux
- install docker-desktop instead
- output informative information to screen, keep user informed of whats going on
- maybe limit output of some programs / screen candy
- check if features are enabled, programs installed and boot manager entries present before going on (especially last one - tricky, no powershell module for that!)
- remove ubuntu appx after install (check successful install?)
